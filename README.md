Retail Attach Rate Analysis & Forecasting📌 Project OverviewThis project is a data analytics pipeline designed to evaluate the Attach Rate performance of retail stores across multiple branches. It processes raw monthly sales data to identify trends, categorize store performance, and forecast future metrics using statistical analysis.The tool transforms static spreadsheets into actionable business intelligence, helping management identify Top Performers to emulate and Low Performers requiring intervention.🚀 Key FeaturesData Normalization: Converts wide-format Excel data (months as columns) into long-format time-series data.Trend Analysis: Calculates the linear trend (slope) for every store to determine if performance is Improving, Stable, or Declining.Performance Categorization: Segments stores into Top, Mid, and Low performers based on dynamic thresholds.Variance Calculation: Identifies consistency issues (high variance) to spot unstable store performance.Forecasting: Predicts next month's (January) performance using a 3-month moving average.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries:pandas (Data manipulation)numpy (Statistical calculations: polyfit, variance)📂 Input Data StructureThe script expects a CSV file (Jumbo & Company_ Attach % .xls - Sheet1.csv) with the following column structure:BranchStore_NameDecNovOctSepAugDelhi_NcrStore A0.230.170.160.250.24PuneStore B0.330.330.360.130.32Note: The script automatically handles the unpivoting of month columns.⚙️ Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/attach-rate-analysis.git
Install dependencies:Bashpip install pandas numpy
Run the analysis:Bashpython analysis_script.py
📊 OutputThe script generates a file named Processed_Store_Analysis.csv containing the following enriched metrics:Avg_Attach_Pct: Mean performance over the period.Trend_Status: Improving / Stable / Declining.Variance: Stability score (higher = less stable).Category: Top Performer / Mid Performer / Low Performer.Jan_Forecast: Predicted value for the upcoming month.Best_Month / Worst_Month: Seasonality indicators per store.💡 Key Insights (Sample Data)Based on the analysis of the sample dataset:Top Branch: Pune (27.7% Avg) outperforms all other regions.Critical Lag: Telangana region is significantly underperforming (11.8%).Seasonality: A clear upward trend is visible company-wide, peaking in November/December.Benchmark: The store Delhi(Hauz Khas) set the company benchmark with a 62.2% average attach rate.🔮 Future ImprovementsAdd visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn) to plot trend lines for "Low Performing" branches.Implement weighted moving averages for more accurate forecasting.Automate PDF report generation for branch managers.
